# Face Attendance Management System using OpenCV


This repository contains an automated Face Attendance Management System using OpenCV, designed to streamline the process of taking attendance by leveraging facial recognition technology.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV's Haar cascades or deep learning-based models for robust face detection.
  
- **Face Recognition:** Implements facial recognition using OpenCV's face recognition module or deep learning models like DLib or FaceNet.
  
- **Attendance Logging:** Logs attendance of recognized faces into a database or CSV file with timestamps.
  
- **User Interface:** Includes a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for easy interaction, enabling users to enroll new faces, start attendance sessions, and view attendance records.
  
- **Database Integration:** Supports integration with SQLite, MySQL, or other databases for storing attendance data securely.
  
- **Real-time Processing:** Optimizes performance with multi-threading for real-time face detection and recognition in video streams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Additional Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-attendance-system.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Enrollment:** Add images of individuals to be recognized for attendance into the system.
   
2. **Execution:** Run the main script to start the attendance management system.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Attendance Tracking:** The system captures live video or processes images to detect and recognize faces, automatically logging attendance.
